# Bash scripts to interact with Salesforce Orgs

I don't know how you got here, but hey, welcome!

Ever had a nice idea to solve something with a quick bash script when you needed
to find some info about a Salesforce org? Say, find out which fields in an
object are encrypted?

This is just a place to hold those kinds of scripts I've come up with. If any of
it is useful to you, help yourself!

None of this comes with user manuals or fancy explanations. It's just a place to
store them. Also, check anything you run against an org before doing so. Just
common sense.
